# Action List Using React and APIs

# Motivation

The aim of this project is to practice my React skills. The second part of the SEI course teaches us to build web applications using React. We also learnt how to use APIs to read data from other sources and render that in our React application. This project pulls all of this knowledge together as well as the javascript, HTML and CSS we learnt for Project 1.

##

Below are the user stories for this project;

* As a user, I should be able to see my list of Action items.
* As a user, I should be able to mark an Action item as complete.
* As a user, I should be able to edit an Action item in the list.
* As a user, I should be able to delete an item from the list.
* As a user, I should be able to delete all items from the list.
* As a user, I should be able to delete only selected items from the list.
* As a user, I should be able to note the location of where my action is taking place.
* As a user, I should be able to see the weather forecast of the location.

# Design Process

## Wireframes

Below shows my initial design for the Actions section of my web app.

From this design I then thought about how I would lay this out with CSS and produced the following design.

Here it can be see that I am planning to use a CSS grid layout with 4 columns. My individual actions will have 4 fields each, 3 of these will be paragraph elements and one select element.

Finally for the tab that displays the weather to the user this is my original design.
